      <strong>PAD - P채dagogischer Austauchdienst</strong>
      <p>Issued by Kulturminister Konferenz (Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs Germany).</p>
      <p>In 2022, as part of River East Collegiate's German program, myself and a number of friends competed in a German video competition with the topic of "Kaufen und Konsum" or buying and consuming, where my group's video, M체llmonster (Garbage Monster), took first place.
        The video was an amazing showcase of group effort, commitment, and a showcasing of skills. M체llmonster is a music video 100% created by our group, lyrics, instrumental, ideas. The video is still played for current German students at RRC and Chief Peguis Jr. High as an example of quality work.

        As a result of winning the video competition, this allowed myself, including 3 group members to take part in the P채dagogische Austauschdienst (PAD) program where we spent one month traveling Germany, experiencing German culture, and improving our skills and abilities in the German language. At the end of the trip we received an official PAD certificate which indicated the completion as well as a testament to our efforts and growth in learning.</p>
