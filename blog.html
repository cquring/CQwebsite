        <p class="blog-date">February 3, 2024</p>
        <p class="blog-content">Hello! This is my first blog post. I figured it would be a good opportunity to share the experience of coding my first website with some prior coding knowledge.
            I do have some experience coding in the past, taking computer science in high school I was taught the Java programming language at a basic level. After some time it took some refreshing while attempting to learn how to code a video game in the Java language.
            But as I came to discover, websites don't use Java, but instead primarily another language called HTML (as well as CSS and JavaScript). After watching a basic YouTube tutorial and following along, I understood the basic concepts. I also looked into how to host the website so that anyone can access it through a search engine. Overall, not as hard as I once thought.
            After exploring existing templates and experimenting with some AI assistance, I am equiped with some limited knowledge to tinker with the website and configure it in a way that suits me. This first version is not the final version, but so far I am happy with the quality of the website given my skill level.
